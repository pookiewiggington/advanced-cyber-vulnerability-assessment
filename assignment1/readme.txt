The pseudocode in listing 1 has a parent process, which creates a child process,
which in turn creates a grandchild process that creates a shell. Each if statement establishes the input and
output pipes to have the parent reading from stdin, writing to the in pipe, and the in pipe
writes to the grandchild process at inpipe[0]. The shell writes to out pipe[1], which sends the data to out pipe[0]
The child process then reads from out pipe[0] and writes to std err. Ultimately, the code sends the data from the parent
to the grandchild and back to the child.
